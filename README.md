Some simple code to experiment with 1D Markov Chains.

Dionysian because one of the experiments is a 1D random walk (often associated with the imagery of a drunken man taking steps at random) and the other is an example of the classical gambler's ruin (so somewhat related to Dionysus, who was also the God of festivities).
